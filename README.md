For each mouse on each session, there is a data structure with many fields, some of which are present only contextually for some session types.
Define the following variables for the below descriptions:

Call the current structure session’s data structure "curd"
"curd" contains many fields, among them:
•	nIC_GrC, nIC_CF - number of GrCs or CFs
•	pixh, pixw - image height and width in pixels
•	ICmat_CF, ICmat_GrC – Npixh X Npixw X Ngrc or Ncf
•	dtb, dtimCb, dtDLC - sampling time step in sec for NIdaq behavioral data, imaging data, and behavioral video data
•	ntb, ntimCb - total # of samples; NIdaq or microscope
•	nc - total number of detected forelimb movements
•	"midAlgn" and "rewAlgn." Each of these fields is in turn another structure
•	Several variables are acquired on the NIdaq and are of length ntb
	- lick - binary lick sensor contacts
	- frameCb - imaging frame counter
	- pos - ntb X 2 matrix of x-y handle positions
	- sol - binary solenoid gate
•	Several variables are based on the microscope acquisiton and have length ntimCb
	- sigFilt_GrC, sigFilt_CF, spMat_CF - nIC_GrC X ntimCb or nIC_CF X ntimCb matrix of z-scored cell fluorescence or binary spike trains
•	goodmvdir - nc X 1 binary vector, 1 for movements that passed start/mid/end/reward alignment tests
•	rewtimes, truestart, midpt, trueend - detected times of reward, and movement start, middle, and end
•	valid_lick_trials, goodDLC - nc X 1 vector, 1 for trials where lick or camera data passed QC
•	tmpxx, tmpxCb, tmpxDLCnew - vector of time stamps centered on 0 sec with sample interval dtb, dtimCb, or dtDLC
curd.midAlgn/startAlgn/rewAlgn fields
•	sigFilt_GrC, sigFilt_CF, sp_CF - [nc X nIC X nt] matrix of GrC or CF zscored fluorescence or CF spikes, trials-by-cells-by-timepoints per trial, nt corrresponds to lengths of tmpxCb
	Center of time axis is 0s wrt movement midpoint, start point, or reward time for midAlgn, startAlgn, rewAlgn respectively
•	sol - nc X nt matrix of binary solenoid openings
•	lick - same but for binary lick sensor contacts
•	pos Nmv X 2 X Nt_b same but for X and Y handle position
